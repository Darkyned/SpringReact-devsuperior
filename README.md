# SpringReact-devsuperior
My Spring React project from the Spring React week event (devsuperior). DSMeta web application that uses the Spring framework (backend with Java and SQL) and 
React (TypeScript, CSS with bootstrap, and HTML) for the frontend.

The DSMeta application obtains data in the backend server with seller names, ids, dates, and amounts; displays them in the frontend, with a filter by date application,
and sms notification.

Since the sms notification is powered by Twilio - with my own personal free trial account - it's functionality is limited to my cellphone, and will only work for about 30
days after the first commit done to this project.
